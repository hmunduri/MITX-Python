## Problem Set 6

### Problem 1

#### Problem 1-1
The ONLY thing we are interested in when designing programs is that it
returns the correct answer.

**False**

#### Problem 1-2
When determining asymptotic complexity, we discard all terms except for
the one with the largest growth rate.

**True**

#### Problem 1-3
Bisection search is an example of linear time complexity

**False**

#### Problem 1-4
For large values of n, an algorithm that takes 20000n^2 steps has
better time complexity (takes less time) than one that takes 0.001n^5
steps

**True**
